DjangoCMS plugin
================

.. Note::
    This is an optional feature during creation of application project. It will only be
    available if you enabled it.

This will define a `DjangoCMS`_ plugin to list articles from a specific selected blog
in a CMS page. The article list may be limited to a length of object or infinite
depending an option.

The plugin is pretty simple and involves a model, a form and a template.

Obviously this is only useful if you already planned to develop application to work
in a `DjangoCMS`_ project.
